OAuth 2.0 uses an external Authorization Server that authenticates the user and authorizes client and issues a JWT (access token) to a client application.
The Resource Server (another app) validates the JWT using the Authorization Server’s public key.
If the user does not exist in the application database, the application creates and stores a local user record based on the token claims.
