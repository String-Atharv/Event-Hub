1. Realms
What is a realm?
A realm is like a separate account system.
Each realm has its own:
Users
Roles
Login rules

One project = one realm

Example:

Realm: college-portal

Users: students, teachers

Roles: student, faculty, admin

Different realms do NOT share users or data.

2. Users
What is a user?
A user is a person who can log in.
A user has:
Username
Password
Email
Roles

Example:

Username: atharv

Email: atharv@college.edu

Role: student

Keycloak stores and verifies user credentials for you.

3. Roles
What is a role?

A role defines what a user is allowed to do.

Simple analogy:

Role = permission tag

Examples:

admin → full access

teacher → manage courses

student → view content

Roles are later checked by your backend or frontend.

4. Login / Signup Configuration
What does this mean?

This controls how users log in or register.

You can configure:

Username + password login

Email verification

Forgot password

OTP / MFA

User self-registration (signup)

Password rules

Example:

Allow users to register themselves

Force strong passwords

Require email verification

Keycloak handles all login screens for you.

5. Connecting Applications (Frontend / Backend)
What does “connect an application” mean?

It means:

“This app will use Keycloak for login.”

In Keycloak, applications are called Clients.

Examples:

React frontend

Spring Boot backend

Mobile app

Each client gets:

Client ID

Security settings

Redirect URLs

6. OAuth2 / OpenID Connect
What are these?

They are standard login protocols.

You don’t need to invent login logic.

What they do:

OAuth2 → authorization (access control)

OpenID Connect → authentication (who the user is)

Simple flow:

User tries to log in

App redirects to Keycloak

User logs in

Keycloak sends back a token

App trusts the token

Keycloak fully implements these standards.

7. Authentication vs Authorization
Authentication

Who are you?

Username

Password

OTP

Handled by Keycloak.

Authorization

What are you allowed to do?

Roles

Permissions

Also managed by Keycloak.

SSO
SSO ensures that once you log in one time, you can access that application and all other connected applications without logging in again.
